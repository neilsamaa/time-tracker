# ⏱️ TimeTracker

**TimeTracker** is a lightweight, single-file web application (`index.html`) for tracking your time, managing projects, and adding tags — all stored using the browser's `localStorage`. No backend needed — just open and use.

## ✨ Features

- ⏳ Time Tracking: Start, pause, and stop your activities.
- 📁 Project Management: Add and select projects for each time entry.
- 🏷️ Tag Management: Assign tags for easier task categorization.
- 💾 Data is automatically saved to your browser using `localStorage`.
